_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Step 1.) After you've activated your prepaid card and phone(s) (depends on the plan you have, all plans are valid for this, even the $25 plan):

Please go to:
https://www.totalwireless.com/rewards

Step 2.) Login with your Total Wireless Username, Phone Number, or E-mail and sign up (Join) for their rewards program. You will get 600 points (use to be only 200 points) just for signing up.

Step 3.) On the next page, enter the promo code, FOUND HERE @ https://rebrand.ly/TotalWireless, when it asks for who referred you. You will get 8,000 bonus points (equal to $80) for this.

IF YOU DO NOT SEE A SMALL WHITE BOX TO ENTER THE CODE IN, GO TO THE FOLLOWING PAGE:
https://rewards.totalwireless.com/home/dashboard?firstLogin=1?language=en

NOTE: MOST ALL other Total Wireless codes will only give you only 5,000, or maybe, maybe 6,000. However, my code gives you 8,000 bonus points.

Step 4.) In total, you will earn 8,600 bonus points ($86), which can be redeemed for a free month (or multiple months being free) and/or can be used to take off some money on a smartphone purchase (via phone promo generated code). If you are using the $35 plan each month, it's essentially months 3, 4 and part of month 5 for free.

Please let me know if you have any problems or have any questions! This doesn't cost you anything. It's an incentive only for new Total Wireless users.
