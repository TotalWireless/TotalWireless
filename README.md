(UPDATED) FREE 8,600 ($86) Bonus Points (Total Wireless Rewards Program) (Use to be 8,200 ($82))

CURRENT/ACTIVE PROMO CODE FOUND HERE @ https://pastebin.com/QpsizLPL

1.) After you've activated your prepaid card and phone(s) (depends on the plan you have, all plans are valid for this, even the $25 plan):

Please go to: https://www.totalwireless.com/rewards

2.) Go ahead and log on with your Total Wireless Username, Phone Number, or E-mail and sign up (Join) for their rewards program. You will get 600 points (use to be only 200 points) just for signing up.

3.) On the next page, enter the promo code (FOUND @ https://pastebin.com/QpsizLPL), when it asks for who referred you. You will get 8,000 bonus points (equal to $80) for this.

MOST ALL other Total Wireless codes will only give you only 5,000, this gives you 8,000 bonus points.

4.) In total, you will earn 8,600 bonus points ($86), which can be redeemed for a free month (or multiple months being free) and/or can be used to take off some money on a smartphone purchase (via phone promo generated code). If you are using the $35 plan each month, it's essentially months 3, 4 and part of month 5 for free.

Please let me know if you have any problems or have any questions! This doesn't cost you anything. It's an incentive only for new Total Wireless users.
